# Fake News Detection System

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to detect fake news articles. It utilizes a subset of the WELFake dataset for training and testing and includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment of an API for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming news articles for machine learning.
- **Fake News Classification**: Classifies news articles as fake or real using a trained model.
- **API for Predictions**: Provides real-time predictions via a REST API.
- **Interactive Testing**: Test API endpoints for functionality and accuracy.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language for model development and deployment.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**: Libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.
- **Flask**: Framework used to build the REST API.
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application (optional).
