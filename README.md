# Fake News Detection System

## Project Overview
This project is all about building a machine learning pipeline to detect fake news articles. I used a smaller subset of the WELFake dataset for training and testing. The project focuses on processing the data, training a model, and deploying an API to make real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared news articles to make them ready for machine learning.
- **Fake News Classification**: Used a trained model to classify articles as fake or real.
- **API for Predictions**: Built a simple REST API for real-time predictions.
- **Interactive Testing**: Tested the API to ensure it works as expected.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language used throughout the project.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**: Libraries for data handling and machine learning.
- **Flask**: Framework for building the API.
- **Git**: To track changes and manage the codebase.
